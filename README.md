1. I would put my automated tests in a GitHub action that runs when code is pushed, so that I can save time. This will happen every time I push code, and it an also run many more tests than I could manually.
2. No, I would use a unit test to check the return value of a function.
3. No, I would not use a unit test since the message feature is such a large component of the messaging app, and it should require much more in depth testing involving many different aspects of the app.
4. Yes, I would use a unit test since this seems relatively simple and could be tested just within one function of the program.
